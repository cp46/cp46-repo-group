  abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is a key trait of successful pest species, and may increase the ability to cope with higher, more variable temperatures under climate change. We investigate the plasticity of preferred temperature in a widespread agricultural pest, the wingless grasshopper (Phaulacridium vittatum). Preferred temperature is a measure of thermoregulatory behaviour through habitat selection. It is influenced by melanism, which affects body temperature by determining the amount of radiation absorbed by the body. First we demonstrate that body temperature and preferred temperature in P. vittatum is influenced by melanism, by comparing the preferred temperature of the colour morphs in laboratory thermal gradients and field body temperatures in natural populations. We then test whether preferred temperature changes in response to changes in body temperature, by determining preferred temperature before and after manipulation of melanism by painting. When melanism was manipulated experimentally in live grasshoppers, preferred temperature changed to reflect the thermal qualities of the new colour. The preferred temperature of light grasshoppers increased after they were painted black, and decreased after being painted white. Similarly, dark individuals that were painted white behaved like a light individual, maintaining a lower body temperature. Preferred temperature in P.vittatum is a plastic thermoregulatory response to ambient temperature, mediated by the influence of melanism on body temperature.},

  abstract = {Aim We explore geographic variation in body size within the wingless grasshopper, Phaulacridium vittatum, along a latitudinal gradient, and ask whether melanism can help explain the existence of clinal variation. We test the hypotheses that both male and female grasshoppers will be larger and lighter in colour at lower latitudes, and that reflectance and size will be positively correlated, as predicted by biophysical theory. We then test the hypothesis that variability in size and reflectance is thermally driven, by assessing correlations with temperature and other climatic variables. Location Sixty-one populations were sampled along the east coast of Australia between latitudes 27.63\textdegree{} S and 43.10\textdegree{} S, at elevations ranging from 10 to 2000 m a.s.l. Methods Average reflectance was used as a measure of melanism and femur length as an index of body size for 198 adult grasshoppers. Climate variables were generated by BIOCLIM for each collection locality. Hierarchical partitioning was used to identify those variables with the most independent influence on grasshopper size and reflectance. Results Overall, there was no simple relationship between size and latitude in P. vittatum. Female body size decreased significantly with latitude, while male body size was largest at intermediate latitudes. Rainfall was the most important climatic variable associated with body size of both males and females. Female body size was also associated with radiation seasonality and male body size with reflectance. The reflectance of females was not correlated with latitude or body size, while male reflectance was significantly higher at intermediate latitudes and positively correlated with body size. Analyses of climate variables showed no significant association with male reflectance, while female reflectance was significantly related to the mean temperature of the driest quarter. Main conclusions Geographic variation in the body size of the wingless grasshopper is best explained in terms of rainfall and radiation seasonality, rather than temperature. However, melanism is also a significant influence on body size in male grasshoppers, suggesting that thermal fitness does play a role in determining adaptive responses to local conditions in this sex.},

  author = {Harris, R. M. B.},

  abstract = {The study of thermal biology can contribute to our understanding of climate change by highlighting the thermal constraints affecting a species and the adaptive mechanisms available. This thesis describes the thermal biology of the wingless grasshopper (Phaulacridium vittatum), to highlight the characteristics that predispose some insect species to cope with, or benefit from, a changing climate. These characteristics include having a wide distribution, broad thermal tolerances, morphological plasticity and a wide range of behavioural responses to temperature. Phaulacridium vittatum is a widely distributed cool temperate species, which exhibits plasticity in melanism and body size. Geographic variation in these characters along a latitudinal gradient was assessed, to test whether variability in body size and melanism reflect adaptations to local thermal conditions. Selection for body size was found to be mediated by different factors in males and females of the wingless grasshopper. Female body size decreased significantly with latitude, while male body size was largest at intermediate latitudes. Geographic variation in the body size of the wingless grasshopper was best explained in terms of rainfall and radiation seasonality, rather than temperature. However, the body size of males was also strongly influenced by reflectance, suggesting that thermal fitness does play a role in determining adaptive responses to local conditions in this sex. The intra-specific application of the thermal melanism hypothesis was tested, firstly by measuring the thermal properties of the different colour morphs in the laboratory, and then by comparing the average reflectance and spectral characteristics of populations along altitudinal gradients in Tasmania. Melanism in P. vittatum represents a gradation in colour rather than distinct colour morphs, with reflectance ranging from 2.49 to 5.65\%. In unstriped grasshoppers, darker morphs warmed more rapidly than lighter morphs and reached a higher maximum temperature (lower temperature excess). No significant differences in thermal quality were found between the colour morphs of striped grasshoppers. In support of the thermal melanism hypothesis, grasshoppers were, on average, darker at higher altitudes; there were differences in the spectral properties of brightness and chroma between high and low altitudes; and temperature variables were significant influences on the average reflectance of female grasshoppers. However, the relationship between melanism and altitude was not consistent across all gradients, demonstrating the importance of habitat differences, and the benefit of studying trends across replicated gradients. The range of thermal conditions typically available to ground-dwelling insects in a cool temperate region was quantified using field measurements of microhabitat temperatures over the period of a year. A steady state biophysical model was developed to predict the operative temperature of a grasshopper, in the absence of behaviour, under varying conditions of temperature, radiation, and wind. The heat capacity of the grasshopper was determined in a passive warming experiment, and used to develop a transient model that enabled thermoregulatory behaviour to be considered. These results were related to the preferred temperature of P. vittatum measured in thermal gradients in the laboratory, illustrating the extent to which microhabitat variability can provide a range of thermal opportunities and potentially alleviate the impacts of climate change on a small ectotherm. The importance of melanism in insect thermoregulation was tested using theoretical and experimental approaches. The biophysical model was used to identify the extent to which melanism contributes to the heat balance of small ectotherms across a range of body sizes and reflectance. In the absence of behaviour, the limiting factor in the heat balance was found to be the degree of melanism, rather than small body size alone. However, in the absence of extreme melanic forms, when behaviour is incorporated by accounting for movement between sun and shade, slight differences in warming times may accumulate to amplify any thermal difference due to melanism. To test whether preferred temperature is a plastic response to ambient temperature, and whether melanism affects behaviour, the preferred temperature of the colour morphs of P. vittatum was determined in a laboratory thermal gradient, before and after manipulating body colour by painting. The preferred temperature of the darkest colour form was significantly higher than that of the lightest form (with a mode of 37.5 \textendash{} 40.0C, compared to 22.5 \textendash{} 25.0C). Painting led to changes in preferred temperature, demonstrating that thermoregulatory behaviour through habitat selection is a plastic response to changes in the iii thermal balance driven by melanism. The laboratory results were supported by measurements of live populations in natural situations. Behavioural experiments were used to determine the means by which P. vittatum regulates its body temperature in natural situations and under artificial warming conditions in laboratory experiments. Common thermoregulatory behaviours were found to be timing of activity, choice of substrates with optimum surface temperatures, and specific behavioural postures such as stilting and vertical orientation. Behavioural responses were constant and covered a range of spatial scales, from several centimetres to many metres, and temporal scales from seconds to hours. Measurements of preferred temperature, upper critical temperature threshold (CTmax) and the Maximum Voluntarily Tolerated temperature (MVT) indicated that P.vittatum has a broad thermal tolerance, which is further extended by the existence of the different colour morphs. The flexible thermal biology of P. vittatum suggests that it has the potential to cope with climate change without the need for significant adaptation or shifts in distribution. This has consequences for its status as an important agricultural pest in Australia, and highlights the potential for other generalist herbivores with similar characteristics to respond to changing climatic conditions.},

Seasonal growth, including seed set, of 3 grass species (western wheatgrass\textemdash needleandthread\textemdash prairie junegrass) was mostly completed before grasshoppers developed to the damaging stage (4th and 5th instars and adults). Clipping studies showed that grass and forb production decreased from 1473 kg/ha in 1975 to 503 kg/ha in 1977 and was directly correlated with spring and summer precipitation. Forage lost to grasshoppers was estimated at 235 kg/ha in 1975, 226 kg/ha in 1976, and none in 1977.},

Even with the emergence of metagenomics, complete circular sequences are rarely identified, and have required manual curation. We propose a robust in silico procedure for identifying complete small plasmids in metagenomic datasets from whole genome shotgun sequencing. From one very pure and exhaustively sequenced metamobilome from rat cecum, we identified a total of 616 circular sequences, 160 of which were carrying a gene with plasmid replication domain. Further homology analyses indicated that the majority of these plasmid sequences are novel. We confirmed the circularity of the complete plasmid candidates using an inverse-type PCR approach on a subset of sequences with 95\% success, confirming the existence and length of discrete sequences. The implication of these findings is a broadened understanding of the traits of circular elements in nature and the possibility of massive data mining in existing metagenomic datasets to discover novel pools of complete plasmids thus vastly expanding the current plasmid database.},

  abstract = {Accurate predictions of the potential distribution of range-shifting species are required for effective management of invasive species, and for assessments of the impact of climate change on native species. Range-shifting species pose a challenge for traditional correlative approaches to range prediction, often requiring the extrapolation of complex statistical associations into novel environmental space. Here we take an alternative approach that does not use species occurrence data, but instead captures the fundamental niche of a species by mechanistically linking key organismal traits with spatial data using biophysical models. We demonstrate this approach with a major invasive species, the cane toad Bufo marinus in Australia, assessing the direct climatic constraints on its ability to move, survive, and reproduce. We show that the current range can be explained by thermal constraints on the locomotor potential of the adult stage together with limitations on the availability of water for the larval stage. Our analysis provides a framework for biologically grounded predictions of the potential for cane toads to expand their range under current and future climate scenarios. More generally, by quantifying spatial variation in physiological constraints on an organism, trait-based approaches can be used to investigate the range-limits of any species. Assessments of spatial variation in the physiological constraints on an organism may also provide a mechanistic basis for forecasting the rate of range expansion and for understanding a species' potential to evolve at range-edges. Mechanistic approaches thus have broad application to process-based ecological and evolutionary models of range-shift.},

They can thus quantify constraints on survival, activity and, ultimately, the vital rates that determine population growth, given a sequence of environmental conditions and the key morphological, physiological and behavioural functional traits. Here we introduce and document the ectotherm model of NicheMapR, an R package that includes a suite of programs for the mechanistic modelling of heat, water, energy and mass exchange between any kind of ectothermic organism and its environment. The NicheMapR ectotherm model is based on a Fortran program originally developed by Porter, Mitchell and Beckman for predicting core body temperature and evaporative water loss as a function of microclimatic conditions and behavioural thermoregulation. The model includes routines for computing steady state body temperature and evaporative water loss given two extreme microclimates (minimum and maximum shade) as computed by the NicheMapR microclimate model. Behavioural options include posture and colour change, shade-seeking, panting, climbing and retreating underground. Here we configure the program to be called from R as part of the NicheMapR package and describe the model in detail including new functionality for modelling whole life-cycle energy and water budgets using Dynamic Energy Budget theory. We include scripts for core operation of the ectotherm model as well as stand-alone R scripts for running the DEB model. Example applications are provided in the paper and in the associated vignettes. The integrated microclimate and ectotherm models should provide a strong thermodynamic basis for determining the effects of environmental change on the behaviour, distribution and abundance of ectothermic organisms.},

The full breadth and depth of Lake Pedder's nature conservation values have seldom been fully recognised, and one aim of this volume is to describe some of those values. However, the aesthetic and inspirational values of the lake and its surrounding mountainous regions have been illustrated and lyrically described by many of those fortunate enough to have visited the original lake (see for example Angus 1975, Neilson 1975, Southwell  1983, Brown et al. 1985). In 1972 Lake Pedder was flooded to create a new and larger artificial lake as part of the Middle Gordon hydro-electric power development. This flooding occurred in the face of a public outcry which was, for an environmental issue, unprecedented in Australia's history, and that heralded the beginning of a new phase in Australian political history in which the environment became a pervasive political issue right up there alongside the economy and other traditional issues. Although environmental concerns had been expressed in Australian society long before this time and earlier political battles had been fought over environmental issues, few would disagree with the assertion that it was the flooding of Lake Pedder, more than any other single event, that irrevocably brought the environment into the general public consciousness in Australia and made it a mainstream political issue. It is noteworthy that it was an event at the periphery of the Australian political scene, rather than in the power centres of Melbourne and Sydney, which challenged the established order and wrought this profound change in the Australian political landscape.},

The full breadth and depth of Lake Pedder's nature conservation values have seldom been fully recognised, and one aim of this volume is to describe some of those values. However, the aesthetic and inspirational values of the lake and its surrounding mountainous regions have been illustrated and lyrically described by many of those fortunate enough to have visited the original lake (see for example Angus 1975, Neilson 1975, Southwell  1983, Brown et al. 1985). In 1972 Lake Pedder was flooded to create a new and larger artificial lake as part of the Middle Gordon hydro-electric power development. This flooding occurred in the face of a public outcry which was, for an environmental issue, unprecedented in Australia's history, and that heralded the beginning of a new phase in Australian political history in which the environment became a pervasive political issue right up there alongside the economy and other traditional issues. Although environmental concerns had been expressed in Australian society long before this time and earlier political battles had been fought over environmental issues, few would disagree with the assertion that it was the flooding of Lake Pedder, more than any other single event, that irrevocably brought the environment into the general public consciousness in Australia and made it a mainstream political issue. It is noteworthy that it was an event at the periphery of the Australian political scene, rather than in the power centres of Melbourne and Sydney, which challenged the established order and wrought this profound change in the Australian political landscape.},

  abstract = {Behavioural thermoregulation was studied in the western horse lubber grasshopper Taeniopoda eques (Burmeister), a native of the Chihuahuan Desert of North America. The grasshoppers regulated their temperature through a series of daily cyclical vertical movements between vegetation and the soil, and by the adoption of four thermoregulatory postures: flanking, crouching, stilting and stem-shading. At dawn, the grasshoppers moved from their nocturnal roost-plants to the ground, returned to bushes during the middle of the day, moved back to the open ground in the afternoon, then reascended vegetation at dusk. The occurrences of the four thermoregulatory postures were synchronized with these microhabitat shifts. During the cooler mornings and afternoons, the insects maximized heat gain by flanking and crouching, achieving thoracic temperatures of up to 16\textdegree C above ambient. Throughout the hot middle of the day the insects stilted and shaded, minimizing heat gain. These behaviours effectively kept the grasshoppers' body temperatures near the preferred temperature (36{$\cdot$}2\textdegree C), but lower than the maximum voluntarily tolerated temperature (41{$\cdot$}9\textdegree C), critical thermal maximum (45{$\cdot$}2\textdegree C) and instantaneous lethal maximum (46{$\cdot$}5\textdegree C). The body size of flanking insects influenced heating and cooling rates, wind effects and temperature excess at equilibrium. Both infrared and visible radiation appeared to elicit flanking. The need and ability to thermoregulate are influenced by this insect's reliance on chemical deterrents for defence.},

  abstract = {Burrowing is an important form of locomotion in reptiles, but no study has examined the energetic cost of burrowing for reptiles. This is significant because burrowing is the most energetically expensive mode of locomotion undertaken by animals and many burrowing species therefore show specialisations for their subterranean lifestyle. We examined the effect of temperature and substrate characteristics (coarse sand or fine sand) on the net energetic cost of burrowing (NCOB) and burrowing rate in two species of the Egernia group of skinks (Liopholis striata and Liopholis inornata) compared with other burrowing animals. We further tested for morphological specialisations among burrowing species by comparing the relationship between body shape and retreat preference in Egernia group skinks. For L. striata and L. inornata, NCOB is 350 times more expensive than the predicted cost of pedestrian terrestrial locomotion. Temperature had a positive effect on burrowing rate for both species, and a negative effect on NCOB for L. striata but not L. inornata. Both NCOB and burrowing rate were independent of substrate type. Burrows constructed by skinks had a smaller cross-sectional area than those constructed by mammals of comparable mass, and NCOB of skinks was lower than that of mammals of similar mass. After accounting for body size, retreat preference was significantly correlated with body shape in Egernia group skinks. Species of Egernia group skinks that use burrows for retreats have narrower bodies and shorter front limbs than other species. We conclude that the morphological specialisations of burrowing skinks allow them to construct relatively narrow burrows, thereby reducing NCOB and the total cost of constructing their burrow retreats.},

  abstract = {Widespread species that exhibit both high gene flow and the capacity to occupy heterogeneous environments make excellent models for examining local selection processes along environmental gradients. Here we evaluate the influence of temperature and landscape variables on genetic connectivity and signatures of local adaptation in Phaulacridium vittatum, a widespread agricultural pest grasshopper, endemic to Australia. With sampling across a 900-km latitudinal gradient, we genotyped 185 P. vittatum from 19 sites at 11,408 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using ddRAD sequencing. Despite high gene flow across sites (pairwise FST = 0.0003\textendash 0.08), landscape genetic resistance modelling identified a positive nonlinear effect of mean annual temperature on genetic connectivity. Urban areas and water bodies had a greater influence on genetic distance among sites than pasture, agricultural areas and forest. Together, FST outlier tests and environmental association analysis (EAA) detected 242 unique SNPs under putative selection, with the highest numbers associated with latitude, mean annual temperature and body size. A combination of landscape genetic connectivity analysis together with EAA identified mean annual temperature as a key driver of both neutral gene flow and environmental selection processes. Gene annotation of putatively adaptive SNPs matched with gene functions for olfaction, metabolic detoxification and ultraviolet light shielding. Our results imply that this widespread agricultural pest has the potential to spread and adapt under shifting temperature regimes and land cover change.},
