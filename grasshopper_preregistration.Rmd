# Study Information

## Title
<!-- Provide the working title of your study. It may be the same title that you submit for publication of your final manuscript, but it is not a requirement. The title should be a specific and informative description of a project. Vague titles such as 'Fruit fly preregistration plan' are not appropriate.

Example: Effect of sugar on brownie tastiness. -->

`r rmarkdown::metadata$title`


## Description
<!-- Please give a brief description of your study, including some background, the purpose of the of the study, or broad research questions. The description should be no longer than the length of an abstract. It can give some context for the proposed study, but great detail is not needed here for your preregistration.

Example: Though there is strong evidence to suggest that sugar affects taste preferences, the effect has never been demonstrated in brownies. Therefore, we will measure taste preference for four different levels of sugar concentration in a standard brownie recipe to determine if the effect exists in this pastry. -->

Thermodynamic constraints limit how species grow, breed, and survive in a given environment based on their energy and water needs. Animals occupy specific thermodynamic niches, which can be used to model population abundances and distributions in changing environments [@kearneyNicheMapRPackageBiophysical2020]. @kearneyModellingSpeciesDistributions2008 used a trait-based approach to investigate the spatial range of the invasive cane toad *Bufo marinus* in Australia. Rather than relying on species occurrences observations, @kearneyModellingSpeciesDistributions2008 linked the physical traits with spatial data through biophysical models and were able to predict range expansion under a warming climate. @kearneyNicheMapRPackageBiophysical2020 developed 'NicheMapR', an R package which implements mechanistic niche modeling for heat, water, energy, and mass exchange between ectothermic organisms and its environment. While traditionally used for reptiles and amphibians, @kearneyNicheMapRPackageBiophysical2020 posited that this software could be applied to a broad range of ectotherms. 

Here, we attempt to use NicheMapR to forecast distribution patterns for the grasshopper species *Phaulacridium vittatum* in response to climate change. Similar to the cane toad, *P. vittatum* is also an ectothermic pest that has become widespread in Australia and whose range will likely shift with changing temperatures [@yadavDetectionEnvironmentalMorphological2019]. We aim to replicate the methods of @kearneyModellingSpeciesDistributions2008, using updated methodology with the 'NicheMapR' R package. We will examine energy budgets and plasticity for *P. vittatum* by assessing ecological traits such as body size, solar absorbtivity, and sex.

## Hypotheses
<!-- List specific, concise, and testable hypotheses. Please state if the hypotheses are directional or non-directional. If directional, state the direction. A predicted effect is also appropriate here. If a specific interaction or moderation is important to your research, you can list that as a separate hypothesis.

Example: If taste affects preference, then mean preference indices will be higher with higher concentrations of sugar. -->

We hypothesize that if we model *P. vittatum*’s mechanistic niche using the software NicheMapR, and rely only on trait-based data rather than species occurrence data, we will be able to determine the range *P. vittatum* occupies. We predict that because *P. vittatum* is well adapted to high temperatures [@yadavDetectionEnvironmentalMorphological2019], its range will expand under a warming climate.

# Design Plan
<!-- In this section, you will be asked to describe the overall design of your study. Remember that this research plan is designed to register a single study, so if you have multiple experimental designs, please complete a separate preregistration. -->


## Study type

**Observational Study**. Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, natural experiments, and regression discontinuity designs. 

## Blinding
<!-- Blinding describes who is aware of the experimental manipulations within a study. Select all that apply. Is there any additional blinding in this study? -->

No blinding is involved in this study.

## Study design
<!-- Describe your study design. Examples include two-group, factorial, randomized block, and repeated measures. Is it a between (unpaired), within-subject (paired), or mixed design? Describe any counterbalancing required. Typical study designs for observation studies include cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies.

This question has a variety of possible answers. The key is for a researcher to be as detailed as is necessary given the specifics of their design. Be careful to determine if every parameter has been specified in the description of the study design. There may be some overlap between this question and the following questions. That is OK, as long as sufficient detail is given in one of the areas to provide all of the requested information. For example, if the study design describes a complete factorial, 2 X 3 design and the treatments and levels are specified previously, you do not have to repeat that information.

Example: We have a between subjects design with 1 factor (sugar by mass) with 4 levels. -->

We conducted a pilot study involving exploratory analyses on simulated *P. vittatum* data. This preliminary analysis optimized our approach to applying NicheMapR software to a new ectothermic species. Simulated data was gathered from a dataset of measured grasshopper traits that had been randomly modified. For simplicity, we only included female grasshoppers from a single site. We inputted wet weight, solar absorptivity, and temperature threshold data into our model to create niche constraints. This initial study helped reveal what sampling size is needed, and additional variables we need to consider for a true analysis. For this preliminary study we only sampled during mid-June, but we will additionally sample during summer (December) in our main study. 

As we have now established a suitable analysis plan, we plan to collect more data from the field. We will then run the model again, using true values for both sexes and all sites. This will help us develop a map of suitable *P. vittatum* habitat under current conditions and test whether this matches true range distribution data for this species. Assuming our model correctly predicts current grasshopper distribution, we can then predict how *P. vittatum*’s range will shift with climate change by running the model under different temperature change scenarios. 

## Randomization
<!-- If you are doing a randomized study, how will you randomize, and at what level? Typical randomization techniques include: simple, block, stratified, and adaptive covariate randomization. If randomization is required for the study, the method should be specified here, not simply the source of random numbers.

Example: We will use block randomization, where each participant will be randomly assigned to one of the four equally sized, predetermined blocks. The random number list used to create these four blocks will be created using the web applications available at https://random.org. -->

Not applicable.

# Sampling Plan
<!-- In this section we’ll ask you to describe how you plan to collect samples, as well as the number of samples you plan to collect and your rationale for this decision. Please keep in mind that the data described in this section should be the actual data used for analysis, so if you are using a subset of a larger dataset, please describe the subset that will actually be used in your study. -->


## Existing data
<!-- Preregistration is designed to make clear the distinction between confirmatory tests, specified prior to seeing the data, and exploratory analyses conducted after observing the data. Therefore, creating a research plan in which existing data will be used presents unique challenges. Please select the description that best describes your situation. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions about how to answer this question (prereg@cos.io). -->

**Registration prior to creation of data**. As of the date of submission of this research plan for preregistration, the data have not yet been collected, created, or realized. 

## Explanation of existing data
<!-- If you indicate that you will be using some data that already exist in this study, please describe the steps you have taken to assure that you are unaware of any patterns or summary statistics in the data. This may include an explanation of how access to the data has been limited, who has observed the data, or how you have avoided observing any analysis of the specific data you will use in your study.

An appropriate instance of using existing data would be collecting a sample size much larger than is required for the study, using a small portion of it to conduct exploratory analysis, and then registering one particular analysis that showed promising results. After registration, conduct the specified analysis on that part of the dataset that had not been investigated by the researcher up to that point.

Example: An appropriate instance of using existing data would be collecting a sample size much larger than is required for the study, using a small portion of it to conduct exploratory analysis, and then registering one particular analysis that showed promising results. After registration, conduct the specified analysis on that part of the dataset that had not been investigated by the researcher up to that point. -->

Existing microclimate data: Six sample sites were selected across the species latitude while keeping longitude relatively constant. All sites are within driving distance to shorten the period over which physical data would be collected. A research station is located at each site, which increases the availability of information about the landscape and has available meteorological data, soil surveys, and elevation information. Some areas, such as Butler’s gorge, contain multiple soil types [@keyTaxonomyGenusPhaulacridium1992]. If applicable, we will note the soil type from directly below where the grasshoppers were collected. We will sample in areas of flat land as changes to aspect and slope can lead to changes in the relevant biotic and abiotic factors [@pembertonSoilsLakePedder2001].

Existing ectotherm data: Some physical traits of *P. vittatum* have been assumed as constant, which were identified in the work of @harrisThermalBiologyWingless2012 and @hewittHatchingDevelopmentRangeland1979. These variables include the temperature at which individuals leave shelter to bask; minimum basking temperature; minimum foraging temperature; the maximum temperature at which activity occurs; and preferred temperature for each sex. Heat lost through surface area has been set to 0.02%, which is approximately 10% of what is lost by semi-fossorial skinks (*Liopholis* spp.), which have larger eyes, mouths, and a great portion of their surface area touches the ground [@kearneyNicheMapRPackageBiophysical2020; @wuMorphologyBurrowingEnergetics2015]. The grasshopper *Taeniopoda eques* will shift their posture to perpendicular to the sun [@whitmanThermoregulationDailyActivity1987], and this behaviour has also been observed in *P. vittatum*.

In our preliminary study, we tested the NicheMapR modelling using six female grasshoppers from a single site, and made use of ectotherm traits from previously published literature as described above [@harrisThermalBiologyWingless2012; @hewittHatchingDevelopmentRangeland1979]. We have confirmed that using traits from this small sample size, we are able to successfully predict species distribution and tolerant temperatures for this species using the NicheMapR modelling with existing microclimate data from a single site. We aim to expand this study with a larger sample size of both males and females over a larger spatial area (multiple sites) but have not yet collected this data. As such, we are unaware of patterns across sites or across sex. We will not be using the data from the six individuals we have used for the pilot study in this pre-registered study, but will keep the modelling workflow that we have established. Accordingly, we have the necessary environmental data needed to run the microclimate modeling portion of NicheMapR for all sites, yet we have only produced this data for a singular site and the remaining microclimates have not been computed. 

## Data collection procedures
<!-- Please describe the process by which you will collect your data. If you are using human subjects, this should include the population from which you obtain subjects, recruitment efforts, payment for participation, how subjects will be selected for eligibility from the initial pool (e.g. inclusion and exclusion rules), and your study timeline. For studies that donÍt include human subjects, include information about how you will collect samples, duration of data gathering efforts, source or location of samples, or batch numbers you will use.

The answer to this question requires a specific set of instructions so that another person could repeat the data collection procedures and recreate the study population. Alternatively, if the study population would be unable to be reproduced because it relies on a specific set of circumstances unlikely to be recreated (e.g., a community of people from a specific time and location), the criteria and methods for creating the group and the rationale for this unique set of subjects should be clear.

Example: Participants will be recruited through advertisements at local pastry shops. Participants will be paid $10 for agreeing to participate (raised to $30 if our sample size is not reached within 15 days of beginning recruitment). Participants must be at least 18 years old and be able to eat the ingredients of the pastries. -->

We plan to visit six sites and perform sample collection within a two-week period in both June (winter) and December (summer). *P. vittatum* is commonly found at each site.  

At each site, grasshoppers will be collected during daylight hours on days with clear skies using a sweep net. Soil type, sex and wet weight will be recorded. As in @harrisThermalBiologyWingless2012, solar absorptivity (or reflectance) will be measured using an Ocean Optics USB2000 spectrophotometer at a measurement angle of 45 degrees in a box with a base of sand glued to cardboard. This process will be repeated until the required sample number is achieved. 

Microclimate data will be generated using the NicheMapR with inputs of latitude, longitude, soil type, elevation, slope, aspect and for each site. Other input parameters were kept standard across all sites and include the sky remaining clear of clouds, the minimum level of shading, whether the model will be computing soil moisture (yes), the length of time the results should be calculated for (1 year), solar attenuation resulting from atmospheric dust, the height at which the temperature is considered for (distance between the ectotherm in question and the ground), and general soil properties. 

## Sample size
<!-- Describe the sample size of your study. How many units will be analyzed in the study? This could be the number of people, birds, classrooms, plots, interactions, or countries included. If the units are not individuals, then describe the size requirements for each unit. If you are using a clustered or multilevel design, how many units are you collecting at each level of the analysis? For some studies, this will simply be the number of samples or the number of clusters. For others, this could be an expected range, minimum, or maximum number.

Example: Our target sample size is 280 participants. We will attempt to recruit up to 320, assuming that not all will complete the total task. -->

We aim to collect 100 grasshoppers per site during two periods of the year - June (winter) and December (summer). As we have selected 6 sites, this will result in 600 grasshoppers per season. 

## Sample size rationale
<!-- This could include a power analysis or an arbitrary constraint such as time, money, or personnel. This gives you an opportunity to specifically state how the sample size will be determined. A wide range of possible answers is acceptable; remember that transparency is more important than principled justifications. If you state any reason for a sample size upfront, it is better than stating no reason and leaving the reader to "fill in the blanks." Acceptable rationales include: a power analysis, an arbitrary number of subjects, or a number based on time or monetary constraints.

Example: We used the software program G*Power to conduct a power analysis. Our goal was to obtain .95 power to detect a medium effect size of .25 at the standard .05 alpha error probability. -->

The above sample size was chosen to allow for higher statistical power while simultaneously considering personnel and time constraints in collecting field data. 


## Stopping rule
<!-- If your data collection procedures do not give you full control over your exact sample size, specify how you will decide when to terminate your data collection. 

You may specify a stopping rule based on p-values only in the specific case of sequential analyses with pre-specified checkpoints, alphas levels, and stopping rules. Unacceptable rationales include stopping based on p-values if checkpoints and stopping rules are not specified. If you have control over your sample size, then including a stopping rule is not necessary, though it must be clear in this question or a previous question how an exact sample size is attained.

Example: We will post participant sign-up slots by week on the preceding Friday night, with 20 spots posted per week. We will post 20 new slots each week if, on that Friday night, we are below 320 participants. -->

Not applicable.

# Variables
<!-- In this section you can describe all variables (both manipulated and measured variables) that will later be used in your confirmatory analysis plan. In your analysis plan, you will have the opportunity to describe how each variable will be used. If you have variables which you are measuring for exploratory analyses, you are not required to list them, though you are permitted to do so. -->


## Manipulated variables
<!-- Describe all variables you plan to manipulate and the levels or treatment arms of each variable. This is not applicable to any observational study. For any experimental manipulation, you should give a precise definition of each manipulated variable. This must include a precise description of the levels at which each variable will be set, or a specific definition for each categorical treatment. For example, “loud or quiet,” should instead give either a precise decibel level or a means of recreating each level. 'Presence/absence' or 'positive/negative' is an acceptable description if the variable is precisely described.

Example: We manipulated the percentage of sugar by mass added to brownies. The four levels of this categorical variable are: 15%, 20%, 25%, or 40% cane sugar by mass. -->

No manipulated variables. 


## Measured variables
<!-- Describe each variable that you will measure. This will include outcome measures, as well as any predictors or covariates that you will measure. You do not need to include any variables that you plan on collecting if they are not going to be included in the confirmatory analyses of this study.

Observational studies and meta-analyses will include only measured variables. As with the previous questions, the answers here must be precise. For example, 'intelligence,' 'accuracy,' 'aggression,' and 'color' are too vague. Acceptable alternatives could be 'IQ as measured by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale' 'percent correct,' 'number of threat displays,' and 'percent reflectance at 400 nm.'

Example: The single outcome variable will be the perceived tastiness of the single brownie each participant will eat. We will measure this by asking participants ‘How much did you enjoy eating the brownie’ (on a scale of 1-7, 1 being 'not at all', 7 being 'a great deal') and 'How good did the brownie taste' (on a scale of 1-7, 1 being 'very bad', 7 being 'very good'). -->

We plan to use the previously published constants for temperature thresholds (°C) that *P. vittatum* survives and responds to. These values differ between males and females. Certain categorical variables like posture, burrowing depth, diurnal, nocturnal and crepuscular activity will be taken from the literature. For example, burrowing depth is measured on a scale of one to ten and because *P. vittatum* cannot burrow well, it will be given a value of one. CT_max (critical thermal maximum), CT_min (critical thermal minimum), diurnal activity and delta_shade were sourced from @kearneyNicheMapRPackageBiophysical2020, as it was not viable to take these measurements in the field.

The wet weight (g), sex (M/F), and solar absorbtivity (%) of every captured grasshopper will be measured in the field. 

The geographic coordinates, elevation, date, and soil type of every sampling site will be recorded. To keep sampling consistent, sites were selected based on certain criteria. For example, sites must be flat (so their aspect and slope will be zero), they must be completely unshaded for at least part of the day (minimum shade will be 0% because of bare ground at sites), and they will be sampled on a day with clear skies. 

Some variables were computed using the model. For example, reflectance was defined as the fraction of light that was reflected off the ground and could vary between 0 (total absorption) and 1 (total reflection). A value of 0.15 will be input into the model to simulate bare soil. Campbell’s (1985) Program 11.1 will be used to simulate soil moisture based on soil depth and vegetation cover [@campbellSoilPhysicsBasic1985].

## Indices
<!-- If any measurements are  going to be combined into an index (or even a mean), what measures will you use and how will they be combined? Include either a formula or a precise description of your method. If your are using a more complicated statistical method to combine measures (e.g. a factor analysis), you can note that here but describe the exact method in the analysis plan section.

If you are using multiple pieces of data to construct a single variable, how will this occur? Both the data that are included and the formula or weights for each measure must be specified. Standard summary statistics, such as "means" do not require a formula, though more complicated indices require either the exact formula or, if it is an established index in the field, the index must be unambiguously defined. For example, "biodiversity index" is too broad, whereas "Shannon’s biodiversity index" is appropriate.

Example: We will take the mean of the two questions above to create a single measure of 'brownie enjoyment.'  -->

All measured values and constant values from the literature will be combined into the Niche Map R software to produce a model of the temperature activity of *P. vittatum* plotted against the month of the year. 

# Analysis Plan
<!-- You may describe one or more confirmatory analysis in this preregistration. Please remember that all analyses specified below must be reported in the final article, and any additional analyses must be noted as exploratory or hypothesis generating.

A confirmatory analysis plan must state up front which variables are predictors (independent) and which are the outcomes (dependent), otherwise it is an exploratory analysis. You are allowed to describe any exploratory work here, but a clear confirmatory analysis is required. -->

## Statistical models
<!-- What statistical model will you use to test each hypothesis? Please include the type of model (e.g. ANOVA, multiple regression, SEM, etc) and the specification of the model (this includes each variable that will be included as predictors, outcomes, or covariates). Please specify any interactions, subgroup analyses, pairwise or complex contrasts, or follow-up tests from omnibus tests. If you plan on using any positive controls, negative controls, or manipulation checks you may mention that here. Remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in your final article.

This is perhaps the most important and most complicated question within the preregistration. As with all of the other questions, the key is to provide a specific recipe for analyzing the collected data. Ask yourself: is enough detail provided to run the same analysis again with the information provided by the user? Be aware for instances where the statistical models appear specific, but actually leave openings for the precise test. See the following examples:

- If someone specifies a 2x3 ANOVA with both factors within subjects, there is still flexibility with the various types of ANOVAs that could be run. Either a repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) or a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) could be used for that design, which are two different tests. 
- If you are going to perform a sequential analysis and check after 50, 100, and 150 samples, you must also specify the p-values you’ll test against at those three points.

Example:  We will use a one-way between subjects ANOVA to analyze our results. The manipulated, categorical independent variable is 'sugar' whereas the dependent variable is our taste index. -->

The hypothesis will be tested using mechanistic statistical modelling as the basis for a species distribution model. A mechanistic approach, as opposed to a correlative approach, will allow us to examine the relationship between underlying factors, when considering the relationship between an organism and its environment, based on environmental data and a biophysical model of the organism (Figure 1). The model we will use is NicheMapR [@kearneyNicheMapRPackageBiophysical2020]. 

The variables to be included are:

1) Microclimate model (i.e., environmental data)

Longitude and latitude, number of years to be calculated by the model, soil type, elevation, soil moisture, the level of shade available to the specimen being modelled, whether the sky is clear, reference height of the specimen (at what temperature above ground should the model calculate temperatures for), slope, aspect, ground reflectance, soil profile, irradiance, and solar attenuation due to dust in the atmosphere.

2) Biophysical ecotherm model (i.e., ecological traits and environmental data)

The wet weight of the animal, the percentage of surface area acting as a free-water exchanger, solar absorbtivity, species shape, the temperature at which the specimen will leave retreat to bask, the specimen’s minimum and maximum foraging temperatures, the species thermal minimum and maximum, maximum temperature at which activity occurs, temperature preference, the depth the species burrow to, whether they are shade seeking, whether it can climb, if it’s nocturnally active, its crepuscular activity, whether it’s diurnally active.

Analytical workflow:

Ectotherm code will be used to compute a basic biophysical model of the organism. The microclimate model will set its external conditions. By changing the external conditions, and the information relating to the ectotherms, over multiple runs, one can see in which locations survival is possible, and make extrapolations about their range (see Figure 1). 

The model can be checked for accuracy by comparing the data in the model to their current and known distribution, as well as past distributions. Should the model predict distributions accurately, then the information is available for future extrapolations.

Inactivity from exceeding its maximum foraging temperature represents T_F Max, dropping below the minimum foraging temperature represents T_F Min, and TF (pref) represents the prefereed temperature.](output/phvi_F_body-temp_time.png)

## Transformations
<!-- If you plan on transforming, centering, recoding the data, or will require a coding scheme for categorical variables, please describe that process. If any categorical predictors are included in a regression, indicate how those variables will be coded (e.g. dummy coding, summation coding, etc.) and what the reference category will be.

Example: The "Effect of sugar on brownie tastiness" does not require any additional transformations. However, if it were using a regression analysis and each level of sweet had been categorically described (e.g. not sweet, somewhat sweet, sweet, and very sweet), 'sweet' could be dummy coded with 'not sweet' as the reference category. -->

The model includes many functions which can be included or omitted from the model by entering the code assigned to the category. Soil type, shape and posture have multiple options to select between. For example, soil type includes options such as clay, loam, silt, and silty clay. Each of which corresponds to a specific number. Most other categorical variables are simply turned on or off by adding <- 0, or <- 1 after the variable name. This applies to other parameters such as rumoist, runshade, clearsky, run.gads, IR, soilgrids, shade_seek, burrow, climb, nocturn, crepus, and diurn. 

## Inference criteria
<!-- What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the information youÍll use (e.g. p-values, bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criterion, where appropriate. Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this?

p-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes are standard means for making an inference, and any level is acceptable, though some criteria must be specified in this or previous fields. Bayesian analyses should specify a Bayes factor or a credible interval. If you are selecting models, then how will you determine the relative quality of each? In regards to multiple comparisons, this is a question with few "wrong" answers. In other words, transparency is more important than any specific method of controlling the false discovery rate or false error rate. One may state an intention to report all tests conducted or one may conduct a specific correction procedure; either strategy is acceptable.

Example: We will use the standard p<.05 criteria for determining if the ANOVA and the post hoc test suggest that the results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis were correct. The post-hoc Tukey-Kramer test adjusts for multiple comparisons. -->

The known current distribution of *P. vittatum* will be considered baseline information and compared with distribution patterns observed from our model with a Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value > 0.05 would be interpreted as substantial evidence of the accuracy of the NicheMapR in modelling distribution patterns of *P. vittatum* and will be used in predicting their likely distribution patterns under a warming climate.

## Data exclusion
<!-- How will you determine what data or samples, if any, to exclude from your analyses? How will outliers be handled? Will you use any awareness check? Any rule for excluding a particular set of data is acceptable. One may describe rules for excluding a participant or for identifying outlier data.

Example: No checks will be performed to determine eligibility for inclusion besides verification that each subject answered each of the three tastiness indices. Outliers will be included in the analysis. -->

Beside the quality control checks performed for weight data, no checks will be performed to determine data eligibility for inclusion. All data collected except the wet weight data were included in the analysis. The excluded wrong wet weight data was replaced with modelled values.

## Missing data
<!-- How will you deal with incomplete or missing data? Any relevant explanation is acceptable. As a final reminder, remember that the final analysis must follow the specified plan, and deviations must be either strongly justified or included as a separate, exploratory analysis.

Example: If a subject does not complete any of the three indices of tastiness, that subject will not be included in the analysis. -->

If the calibration procedure employed to set up the weighing scale to measure wet weights is erroneous and results in the recording of wrong values, the mean indices of sexual size dimorphism (SSD= female weight/male weight) as described by [@bidauBreakingRuleMultiple2016] will be adopted to generate missing wet weight values.

## Exploratory analyses (optional)
<!-- If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time.

Example: We expect that certain demographic traits may be related to taste preferences. Therefore, we will look for relationships between demographic variables (age, gender, income, and marital status) and the primary outcome measures of taste preferences. -->

Not applicable.

<!-- If there is any additional information that you feel needs to be included in your preregistration, please enter it here. Literature cited, disclosures of any related work such as replications or work that uses the same data, or other context that will be helpful for future readers would be appropriate here. -->
